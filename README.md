Ansible is a software tool which enables you to have an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) type of workflow
to your cloud infrastructure. It allows you to provision, deploy and configure multiple resources at the execution of a yaml script.

In this repo, I have used Ansible to host two web servers that run PHP-Apache2 on Ubuntu virtual machine (EC2 Instances).
I use Ansible on a master virtual machine (Ubuntu) that configures changes to the two servers.
